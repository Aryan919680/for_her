  In a world full of chaos, you are my calm.<br/>
  Your smile lights up my day, your presence gives meaning to every moment.<br/>
  Thank you for being my sunshine, my strength, and my everything.<br/><br/>
  Every heartbeat of mine echoes your name.<br/>
  You make ordinary moments feel magical just by being in them.<br/>
  I don't need a perfect worldâ€”just one where you're by my side.<br/>
  Your laughter is my favorite song, your eyes my favorite view.<br/><br/>
  With every breath I take, I love you more than the last.<br/>
  You're not just a part of my lifeâ€”you are my life.<br/>
